This repo is the deployed version of the vite react app for the parking vrr vrr project.

 is a web application designed to help drivers find free parking near public transport facilities. The goal is to offer users more parking options, especially when park 'n' ride facilities are full.

## Project Overview
# Original Concept
The initial idea was to assist drivers in locating local street parking around park 'n' ride locations near public transport facilities.

# Final Project Concept
This is an interactive webapp that utilizes regional databases and datasets to find free parking locations near public transport facilities. It includes features like search options, interactive maps, fastest route generation, and markers for parking spots, bus stops, and train stations within a specified radius.

# Main Features
1. Search option for start and end locations
2. Interactive maps with generated routes
3. Markers for parking spots, bus stops, and train stations
4. Display of nearby public transport information
5. Filtering of parking spots based on user preferences
# Purpose of the Concept
The Parking Ranger aims to address the challenges of finding affordable and available parking in unfamiliar locations. Current navigation apps often prioritize paid car parks, leading to time-consuming and costly searches for free parking. The website seeks to provide an alternative by making free parking locations more accessible, encouraging the use of public transport and contributing to a healthier environment.

# Target Audience
The target audience for ParkFinder is young adults (19-30 years old) with cars, who value time and seek budget-friendly, time-saving solutions. The website aims to relieve them of the stress of parking, allowing them to make the most of their prime years without unnecessary fines or fees.
